# Reservation System 

Hi all!

This is the first version of the restaurant reservation system. 

Technologies used:
- Python3, Django
- HTML

This project enables:

The restaurant guest:
- may view the contact information for all the branches of the corporation. The data is pulled from the database.
- may submit a message for the restaurant.
- may check which tables are available for the selected date/time.
- may reserve the selected table for the selected date/time.

Restaurant owner:
- may automize the table reservation system. The app takes care of reservation details whether the date is in the future, the restaurant is open during the selected hours etc.
- may receive messages for general questions/ wishes from the restaurant guest.
- may update the restaurant info by using the admin page.


Recommendations for the upcoming versions:
- Front-end part is considered minimally, next versions may develop the front-end by using HTML/CSS/JS or similar.
- As the current version provides table selection, a graphical ilustration of the restaurant should be added.
This will guide the restaurant guests for making optimum selections. 
If the restaurant has sea-view/scenery tables, easy to access tables, those should be marked carefully.
